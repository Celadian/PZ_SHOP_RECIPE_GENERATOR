# PZ_SHOP_RECIPE_GENERATOR
Turns a list of lines comma separated into recipes. 

Converts csv files from input into recipe text files in output.

You can go to the link here
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10prL77W5hVMRwuRhYPEHwfJQ6hDm3HQoUp84thegcZk/edit?usp=sharing
and either copy it to edit it or just use it as is. 

Go to File > Download > Comma Separated Value (.csv)

Do that with as many files as you need.

The name of the file e.x: (Test.csv)
Will become the name of the category

So the example file becomes

SShop_Test.txt with formatted recipes.

Running the application again will overrwite the existing files in output or create new ones if none exist. 


Comma separated values are

(TransactionType(Buy/Sell)) (Identifier("clothes")) (DisplayName("T-Shirt Red")) ((ItemName("T_Shirt_Red_KY")) ((Money(Buy for or sell for)) ((Time(No default yet. Must include))

Feel free to modify this application or use it however you want. 
Happy modding.
